            p For the past two years I have had the priviledge to work with some of Connecticut's best and brightest high school students. HOBY works with children to promote leadershipt, critical thinking, teamwork, and over coming adversity.
            p HOBY does a monthly community outreach activity that is meant to give back (Ronald McDonald House dinners, pack the bus drives, etc..) and once a year for the last weekend in May CT public schools nominate students to come to a 3 day leadership seminar.

            p Led by Dr. Carolyn C. Matheus and Dr. Kevin M. Gaugler, myself and several of my fellow students worked to create a curriculum to teach basic computer science concepts. 
            p The students were always ready to learn and they were more than happy to share their culture. Soccer balls and baseballs were always present and our 6 hour summer school day was always capped with a 15 minute school dance in the courtyard.
