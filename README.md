Revamp and update my website 

This will be a new take at my current website: bthegarty.com
I will use new skills i've been learning like Express, Node, pug, and sass

This repository hosts the code for my live website. 

## Future

I am trying to learn better practices and I use this site to practice my web skills which I am always looking to improve and get creative feedback on. I hope you enjoy.
